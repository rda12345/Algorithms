# Algorithms
The repository contains codes for various algorithms. Each file contains the code an a bit of explanation on each algorithm.

Algorithms:

## Search algorithms ##

1. Depth first search for the shortest path on a tree
2. Breadth first search for the shortest path on a tree
3. Binary search

## Sorting algorithms ##

sort_algorithms.py and quick_sort.py contain a codes for:
1. Inspection sort
2. Bubble sort
3. Selection sort
4. Merge sort
5. Quick sort

The file compares thier running times and plots the results.

## Matrix multipication ##
1. Strassen algorithm
