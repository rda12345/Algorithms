# Algorithms
The repository contains code for various algorithms. Each file contains the code and a bit of explanation on each algorithm.

Algorithms:

## Shortest path ##

- Depth-first search for the shortest path on a tree
- Breadth-first search for the shortest path on a tree
- Floyd-Warshall
- Bellman-Ford
- Dijkstra
- Topological sort


## Sorting algorithms ##

sort_algorithms.py and quick_sort.py contain codes for:
- Inspection sort
- Bubble sort
- Selection sort
- Merge sort
- Quick sort

## Matrix operations
- matrix inversion using LU, LUP decompositions
- solution of linear equations using the matrix inversion functions

## General
